# Deeper Networks for Image Classification


## Task
Performing and evaluating image classification tasks with deeper networks 

## Requirements
1. use at least two deep networks including VGG, ResNet, GoogleNet
2. use MNIST dataset for the image classification task. Moreover, we encourage you to use extra datasets (such as CIFAR, 
Tiny-Imagenet) to further evaluate the deeper networks
